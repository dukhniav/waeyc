<h1>Clock Hours</h1>
If you wish to provide OSPI Clock Hours for your attendance at the event please refer to the information below.

IMPORTANT!&nbsp; To be eligible for clock hours, you must supply a minimum of 3 hours of training.

Attendees must attend all three hours of training and sign an attendance sheet to document their participation.

At the END of the event (not sooner) attendees must pay $3 per clock hour to the providing agency.

Once their payment has been collected and documented you may give them the completed in-service form.

Please note: This form is their clock hours. It is their responsibility to submit that form to whatever entity is recording their hours (school district, etc.). We always recommend participants take a copy of their form before turning it in.

After your event is completed you will send a copy of the sign in sheets as well as payment to WAEYC. The payment will be in the amount of $2 per every hour provided or for this event $6 per participant.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
